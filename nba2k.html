	<h2>NBA 2K21</h2>
	<p>NBA 2K21 is a basketball simulation game that's decimated by micro-transactions. This game is a prime example of a money grab and just a genuine rip off.<br /> I've been purchasing this basketball game for 5 years, and the amount of new content, or fixed bugs is almost non-existent.<br /> The gameplay... well its there, when playing the single player Mycareer mode which is honestly really fun. The story that they attempt to get you invested in is very lackluster and forgettable but not the worst!.<br /> And don't get me started on the recycled character models and assets. Sure they polish them little by little, but a polished turd is still a turd at the end of the day.<br /> This game cost 60$ USD but if you plan to play online and want to be able to do the bare minimum It'll cost you  120$ USD just to keep up with the other pay to win players.<br /> So with that being said I give this game a 4/10 and thats being nice! From the recycled assets to the pressure of having to pay to win I will never recommend this game, not even to my worst enemy.</p>
