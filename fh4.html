<h2> Forza 4 Horizon </h2>
<p>  Forza Horizon 4 Is an open world racinig/driving game, its best known for its deep mechanics with car customization.<br /> Though this is one of its best features its also one of its short comings. While you're in the garage to modify your ride you have a options to change your cold air intake,ignition,pistons,flywheel,etc.   <br /> What I'm trying to say is that there are alot of modifications you can do to your engine. None of these alter the sound or cosmetics of your vehicle which is a huge bummer and feels like a missed opportunity.<br />
  Despite that small gripe, everything else is flawless!The graphics are immaculate. The cars feel like they behave very similar to how a car handles in real life. And being able to meet up with your friends and go for a road trip is nothing short of amazing.<br /> All in all I give this game a solid 8.5/10 and I definetly recommend anyone to buy it! </p>
