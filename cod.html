	<h2>Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War</h2>
	<p>I've been playing Call of Duty since I was 13. I've put thousands of hours into the game. I went semi-pro in Black Ops 2 so I know a little something something about the franchise.<br /> Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War is one of the most bug riddled game I've played in a long time. <br /> This Call of Duty has problems with server connection, hit registration problems, a bug in which if you go to a specific menu in the leaderboards it will completely crash your game. All of these problems and I haven't even mentioned how poorly the game is optimized. <br />This game eats my computers resources and doesn't look back. It would make sense if the game was developed by a third-party developer, and I would even be a bit more understanding, but thats not the case Activision has a ton of resources. <br /> I could never recommend this game especially if they were wanting to experience the classic Call of Duty feel. With that being said I'd still give this game a 6/10 the only redeeming feature is the zombies game mode. </p>
